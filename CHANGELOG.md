## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffold: TypeScript on Node 26, strict lint and type gates, 100% coverage gate,
  file-size and commit-subject gates, pinned CI with CodeQL, Scorecard and Dependabot.
- Repository-wide gates: actionlint, shellcheck and shfmt, markdownlint, cspell (en-GB),
  eslint-plugin-regexp, eslint-plugin-n, eslint-plugin-unicorn, @vitest/eslint-plugin,
  dependency-cruiser layering rules, lockfile-lint, sort-package-json, editorconfig-checker,
  gitleaks and `npm audit signatures`, with non-npm tools pinned in `.mise.toml`.
- Minimal server with validated configuration, redacting logger and health probes.
- Full configuration schema (spec §08): every variable validated in one pass, `_FILE` variants
  for secrets with permission warnings, duration and URL rules, and a masked start-up summary.
- Specification (`docs/spec/`), delivery plan, threat model and initial ADRs.
- Packaging (spec §09): a multi-stage container image on digest-pinned `node:26-bookworm-slim`
  with the Bitwarden CLI pinned by version and SHA-256 per architecture, a non-root user and a
  curl-free health check; `docker-compose.yml` with Caddy, file-mounted secrets and a read-only,
  capability-free container; Caddy and nginx snippets in `deploy/proxy/`; `install.sh` for
  Debian and Ubuntu with checksum-verified Node, CLI and release tarball and a hardened systemd
  unit; a tag-driven release workflow that publishes the signed multi-arch image with SBOM and
  provenance and a GitHub release with `vaultgate-<version>.tgz` and its `.sha256`; a hadolint
  gate and a pull-request image build.
- Azure Container Apps deployment (spec §09.3): `deploy/azure/` ARM template with linked
  modules (Log Analytics, Container Apps environment, Key Vault with RBAC and purge protection,
  Azure Files share at `/data`, single-replica Container App with Key Vault secret references),
  a portal form with a Deploy to Azure button, a README covering custom domains and first-run
  bootstrap, and an ARM-TTK template validation job in CI.
